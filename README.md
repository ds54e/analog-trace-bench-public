# Analog Trace Bench

Recorded AI analog-circuit design trials: design decisions, tool actions,
submitted SPICE, and independent electrical evaluation.

Browse results by [Model](https://ds54e.github.io/analog-trace-bench/) or
[Task](https://ds54e.github.io/analog-trace-bench/tasks.html). The catalog contains
219 trials across nine SKY130 OTA and LDO tasks and nine models. Eight models
have three runs per task; Fable 5.1 has one run each for LDO-LOW-VOLTAGE, LDO-QUIET,
and OTA-WIDE. Failed trials are included.

Each trace shows the saved public messages, commands, and results, followed by
the exact submitted circuit and its evaluation. Original evidence is available
as SHA-256-verified [Release assets](https://github.com/ds54e/analog-trace-bench/releases).
The [task index](data/tasks/index.json) links the captured task definitions.

This repository contains the public evidence catalog, website sources, and
analysis tools. Browsing and building recorded results require no PDK, simulator,
or provider credentials.

## Build and preview

Python 3.10+ is sufficient to build and validate saved pages:

```sh
python3 tools/build_site.py
python3 tools/check_site.py
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory site
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/`. See [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for tests,
Windows commands, and importing new traces.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| `content/traces/` | Canonical summary and trace fragments for each run. |
| `site/assets/` | Shared styles and run navigation. |
| `site/data/` | Run catalog, token costs, and full-precision evaluation reports. |
| `data/` | Evidence identities, captured task definitions, validation profiles, and pricing snapshots. |
| `tools/` | Site generation, validation, evidence reading, and trace import. |
| `tests/` | Tooling and run-navigation tests. |
| [skills/](skills/README.md) | Reusable schematic drawing and verification guidance. |

Generated HTML is excluded from Git. Only `site/` is deployed to GitHub Pages;
original archives remain in Release assets and ignored local `evidence/`.
Website deployment uses a separate manual workflow.
